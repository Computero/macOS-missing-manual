# macOS-missing-manual
A centralized hub for all things MacOS. This will be for all intents and purposes a community driven documentation collection to provide the resources that Apple does not properly prvide for customers.

If you want to make additions to this manual, feel free to fork and submit pull requests for your changes. I am doing this solo, so there is no guarantee that I will get to the request in a timely manner but I will get to them all.
